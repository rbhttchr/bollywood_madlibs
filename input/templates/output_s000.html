    Welcome to our first edition of BollyTalk. Well, my friends, the latest buzz buzz is that <b>{{tuple.Bollywood_Actress_Name}}</b> has undergone major plastic surgery.
    She could not stand the verbal abuse she was receiving from her recently acquired beau, <b>{{tuple.Bollywood_Actor_Name}}</b>.
    He was constantly telling her that her <b>{{tuple.Body_Part_1}}</b> was too big and her <b>{{tuple.Body_Part_2}}</b> was way too small for his taste.
    Knowing that this was her only chance at true love, the decision was made to undergo the surgery.
    <br><br>
    What a mistake this proved to be my friends.
    <b>{{tuple.Bollywood_Actress_Name}}</b> has become the laughing stock of Bollywood.
    Some say that after the surgery, she now has a striking resemblance to <b>{{tuple.Old_Bollywood_Actor}}</b>.
    We have tried to contact the once ravishing actress at her <b>{{tuple.Noun}}</b> (in <b>{{tuple.Country}}</b>), but we keep getting the runaround.
    Her <b>{{tuple.Occupation_1}}</b> says she <b>{{tuple.Past_Tense_Verb}}</b> for the weekend and has not been available for the past 3 days.
    Her <b>{{tuple.Occupation_2}}</b> says that her mother was <b>{{tuple.Adjective_1}}</b> and needed <b>{{tuple.Bollywood_Actress_Name}}</b>'s care.
    <br><br>
    Whatever the excuse, we know that our <b>{{tuple.Adjective_2}}</b> damsel is running away from her public and wishes not to be seen.
    The important issue here, however, is that no matter how <b>{{tuple.Adjective_3}}</b> she looks our support is with her <b>{{tuple.Number_between_1_and_10}}</b>% of the way.
    Now, I call that true devotion on the part of her fans, wouldnâ€™t you think?
