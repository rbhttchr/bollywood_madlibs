    <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b> is born into a wealthy Indian family and has a little brother named <b>{{tuple.male_name_2}}</b>.
    They get along really well and grow up and <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b> gets married to <b>{{tuple.girl_name}}</b>.
    <b>{{tuple.number}}</b> years go by and <b>{{tuple.male_name_2}}</b> has a lovely girlfriend who is unfortunately of a lower caste and thus his parents highly disapprove of the relationship.
    Because of the drama caused, <b>{{tuple.male_name_2}}</b> ends up eloping and <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b> goes out on a quest to find out where they’ve gone to potentially reconcile the differences.
    He starts out by asking his neighbors, and they say that they overheard their <b>{{tuple.relative_1}}</b>’s <b>{{tuple.animal_1}}</b>’s owner’s <b>{{tuple.relative_2}}</b> talking about how <b>{{tuple.male_name_2}}</b> mentioned traveling to <b>{{tuple.city}}</b>.
    <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b> books a ticket on the earliest <b>{{tuple.mode_of_transportation}}</b> and travels to <b>{{tuple.city}}</b>.
    <br><br>
    In <b>{{tuple.city}}</b>, <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b> had no idea where to look.
    He hailed a taxi to his <b>{{tuple.noun_2}}</b> and arrived without incident.
    As he got out of the taxi, a familiar laugh echoed from across the corner of the street.
    It was him! <b>{{tuple.male_name_2}}</b>!
    He hurriedly got out and <b>{{tuple.past_tense_verb_1}}</b> towards <b>{{tuple.male_name_2}}</b>, but before he could cross the street, they got into an Uber.
    Dismayed, <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b> quickly took a picture of the Uber’s license plate and used it to find the driver’s phone number.
    He called the driver and he told them <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b> and <b>{{tuple.girl_name}}</b> were traveling to a local zoo.
    <b>{{tuple.male_name_2}}</b> hailed the same Uber driver, <b>{{tuple.male_name_3}}</b>, to take him to the same zoo.
    Upon getting there, scoured the Zoo, from <b>{{tuple.animal_2}}</b> to <b>{{tuple.animal_3}}</b>, with no sign of <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b>.
    The zoo was closing so <b>{{tuple.male_name_2}}</b> had to leave, but on the way out he heard the distinctive “<b>{{tuple.slogan}}</b>” characteristic of his brother <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b>.
    He whipped around and <b>{{tuple.past_tense_verb_2}}</b> towards the source of the voice. Lo and behold, it was <b>{{tuple.male_name_1}}</b> and his <b>{{tuple.noun_1}}</b>, getting into a Lyft.
